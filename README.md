# Project - "Exelerate"

Submitted by: **Larnell Moore, Han Lee, Gurshabd Varaich, Jathushan Krishamohan**

**Exelerate* is an analytical automation tool that seeks to plot data provided by the user and allow them to communicate with a GPT-POWERED AI Agent to ask questions about the data.

## Challenge

The company had the challenge of lack of optimization of their business and developing new 
products. The company needs means to increase plant efficiency and utilization, reduce paperwork, and become more optimized with 
their business, the challenge will be resolved with a system that ingests manufacturing plant data 
(.xlsx), preprocesses the data, and has a visualization to allow users to filter a map by plant 
capabilities, country, available logistics (train/road/boat/plane), and plant availability. 

## Solution

This project also tackles the automobile organization Yazaki's Challenge statement by implementing a heatmap visualization of its Excel data with adaptive filtering also with its ability to answer users' questions in real-time.            

This program was designed and developed within 24 hours for the Hack Dearborn Disrupt Reality Event using Python, 
Streamlit, OpenAI, and langchain.   
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Challenges during the development.

The main challenge during the development was how the data can be transformed for the purpose of data visualization. We tried to insert each element in an array, but we ended up with a better solution to use a dataframe class object.
